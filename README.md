# runepacts

A pipeline that automatically generates the needed files for gene-based tests using EPACTS, and creates visualizations that help in interpreting burden test results. 

* Authors: Shweta Ramdas (sramdas@umich.edu), Ryan Welch (welchr@umich.edu), Tanya Teslovich (teslo@umich.edu)

## Requirements

* Python 2.7.x is required. 3.x is not supported. 
* R 3.1.x must be installed with standard packages (lattice, grid, stats, etc.) 

To view the visualizations created by the pipeline, you will need a modern web browser. The latest version of Chrome is the best option, and Firefox usually works too. IE and Safari are hit and miss. 

## Installation

To install, simply run the bin/setup.py script. This script requires an internet connection and permissions to write within the directory tree.
